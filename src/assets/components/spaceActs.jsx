						(Sec. 102) It is the sense of Congress that it is in the public
						interest to update the methodology used to calculate the maximum
						probable loss from commercial space launch liability claims with a
						validated risk profile approach in order to consistently compute
						valid and reasonable maximum probable loss values.
					</p>
					<p className=" text-white text-lg p-4 m-4">
						The Department of Transportation (DOT) shall: (1) evaluate and, if
						necessary, develop a plan to update, the methodology used to

						permit notwithstanding the issuance of any launch or reentry
						license. Neither shall the issuance of such a license invalidate an
						experimental permit.
