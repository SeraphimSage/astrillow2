# About

This project was originally part of a full-stack capstone project with Kenzie Academy. The project itself took data provided by NASA near earth objects API and represented these in a looping fashion in a computer rendered representation on a model solar system with points for major planets, the sun, and the objects that were returned. These could be filtered to show only a single object or multiple. The goal was to create a platform to demonstrate ability in a fun and engaging way. The idea came from looking at new laws at the time that would help private companies and individuals to lay claim to objects in outer space and lay the ground work for how these rights would be determined in a court of law. This application would be used to find objects, their estimated worth, and create a social project to pool resources and determine parties interested in reaching and harvesting resources from the object. The original project had logins, but did not have fully flushed out messaging implemented due to time constraints. The original front-end of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/drewradcliff/astrillow-frontend).
